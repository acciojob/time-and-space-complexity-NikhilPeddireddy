	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to execute as a function of the input size. An algorithm is considered efficient if it can handle larger inputs without a significant increase in execution time.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is another essential aspect of algorithm analysis. It refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm uses as a function of the input size. In the context of <b>Space Complexity</b>, the notation O(n) indicates that the space used by the algorithm increases linearly with the input size. Optimizing space complexity is important to ensure that an algorithm can handle varying input scales without running out of memory.</p>
